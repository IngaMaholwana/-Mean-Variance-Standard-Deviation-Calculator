# Mean Variance Standard Deviation Calculator

## Description
The **Mean Variance Standard Deviation Calculator** is a Python-based project that computes statistical metrics such as mean, variance, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, and sum for a given list of nine numbers. The project leverages the powerful `numpy` library for numerical computations.

This project is part of the FreeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python curriculum. It demonstrates how to manipulate data using arrays and perform statistical calculations efficiently.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or higher
- `pip` (Python package manager)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator.git
   cd mean-variance-standard-deviation-calculator
   ```

### Features
Computes the following metrics for a 3x3 matrix derived from a list of nine numbers:
Mean
Variance
Standard Deviation
Maximum
Minimum
Sum
Handles invalid input gracefully by raising a ValueError if the input list does not contain exactly nine numbers.
Includes unit tests to ensure correctness.
